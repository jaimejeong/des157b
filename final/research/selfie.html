                One thing I found interesting about the seal was how framework of the seal was inspired by the bicycle wheel. As Davis known as a bike city, the circular design of the seal was a creative way to express one of the unique characteristics that Davis has. In addition to that, I also found it intriguing how the seal represents the past, present, and future of Davis and displays its connection between them.

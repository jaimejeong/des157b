            <p>By testing my paper prototype with Raymond, I learned that all user interaction, like clicking or scrolling, is clear. The first three paper prototypes are how I imagine the website would look, and the bottom two paper prototypes are some features I want to include in this project. I added the last two to get some insights on what they think since I wasn't too sure about my project. From this test, I got the idea of combining them. For example, on the front page, there would be a picture of the seal, and when you scroll down, there would be a section where visitors could share their stories. Overall, this was a great way to test out how the interface of my project would look and how it would work.

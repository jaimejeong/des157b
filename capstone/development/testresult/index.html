        <h2>Observations From User Testing</h2>
        <p>Both groups gave me feedback that having a better indication of which section is clickable would be nice and user-friendly. The user testing made me focus and question who the target audience is, how I want to make the project more interesting, and what kind of vibe I am going for. </p>

        <div id="feedback">
            <h3>Tester 1 : Kimberly & Matthew</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The 3 sections can stand out more by adding some animations like expanding or zooming in to each section when they are hovered over.</li>
                <li>Instead of placing a project overview section on the top of the page, another idea would be to have an icon like a question mark or a letter i for information placed on the top right of the page. This way, the whole seal can still grab the userâ€™s attention while giving the option to read the project brief and understand the mission of the project. </li>
                <li>The color palette of the website can be changed by adding some blue because blue is a color that is commonly found in Davis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tester 2: Dilara</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to tester 1, adding a glow effect, fade-in, or an icon when the mouse hovers over each section would give a better clue to the user that that section is clickable.</li>
                <li>Zooming in or enlarging a section could be a cool idea when the section is clicked.</li>
                <li>Changing the title that includes some keywords like inclusivity would help the users easily understand what the theme for the project is.</li>
                <li>The orange color is bright and nice, but the overall color scheme is a bit gloomy. The color palette can be changed depending on how I want the users to feel. (welcoming? serious?)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Plans on Updating My Capstone Project</h2>
        <div id="plan">
            <p>I plant to ...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>add a filter or an animation to the 3 panels that are clickable for better clues for the users.</li>
                <li>change the color palette that is more welcoming to the users</li>
                <li>change the name/title</li>
                <li>add more context/information</li>
                <li>add a section for submitting responses and viewing them</li>
                <li>add an introduction that explains the project brief</li>
            </ul>

                A topic I have in mind for this project is users adding stories related to seal elements. The way I visualize this is that first you will see the whole seal, and when you hover over each panel or specific section, the theme of that section will be indicated, and that section will darken at the same time. When you click, there will be a short explanation of that part of the seal or the history of it, as well as a section where you can write your own stories and post them on the community board. Once submitted, you can see everyone else’s response in all themes, or you can even categorize by a theme of your choice.

                I haven’t thought about working with a partner yet. I would prefer to work on this independently, but if someone else is also interested in this topic, I wouldn’t mind working with them.

                I think more challenges will come up as I actually start working, but one concern I have so far is displaying on mobile. I’m assuming most visitors would access the website through their phone, so I’m a little bit worried about coding for the mobile version because I haven’t done that in a while. Also, I want to show the whole seal, but I think each panel would be too small to press with a finger since the screen isn’t that big. If I go with this topic, I think a possible solution for this is to create two different kinds of versions for better layout and display depending on the user’s device.
